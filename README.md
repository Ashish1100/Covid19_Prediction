# Covid19 Prediction
##Covid-19 is a novel strain of coronavirus that causes a respiratory illness. It was first identified in Wuhan, China in 2019 and has since spread to become a global pandemic. Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, and it can lead to severe illness or death, particularly in older adults and those with underlying health conditions. The virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it can also spread by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching one's face.

These prediction is done by using data such as the number of confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, testing data, demographic data, and other relevant information. The predictions are based on assumptions and uncertain parameters, so it's important to note that the predictions are not always accurate. Predictive models are also continuously updated as new data and information becomes available, and they are often used in conjunction with other data, expert opinions, and qualitative information.
